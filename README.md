# Association-rule-mining-using-Apriori-algorithm


This python program takes in the items in each transaction and gives out strong association rules.
If two items repeat in a transaction example
T1: Item1, Item2, Item1
T2: Item1
then it assigns the support count of Item1 as 2 (1 from T1 and T2 each)
